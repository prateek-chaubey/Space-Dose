Note that under some legislations we may be allowed to process information until you object to such processing (by opting out), without having to rely on consent or any other of the following legal bases below.

In any case, we will be happy to clarify the specific legal basis that applies to the processing, and in particular whether the provision of Personal Data is a statutory or contractual requirement, or a requirement necessary to enter into a contract.
<br><br>
<h3>Information transfer and storage</h3>
Depending on your location, data transfers may involve transferring and storing your information in a country other than your own. You are entitled to learn about the legal basis of information transfers to a country outside the European Union or to any international organization governed by public international law or set up by two or more countries, such as the UN, and about the security measures taken by us to safeguard your information.

<br><br>

You may exercise certain rights regarding your information processed by us. In particular, you have the right to do the following: <br><br>(i) you have the right to withdraw consent where you have previously given your consent to the processing of your information;<br> <br>(ii) you have the right to object to the processing of your information if the processing is carried out on a legal basis other than consent; <br><br>(iii) you have the right to learn if information is being processed by us, obtain disclosure regarding certain aspects of the processing and obtain a copy of the information undergoing processing; <br><br>(iv) you have the right to verify the accuracy of your information and ask for it to be updated or corrected; <br><br>(v) you have the right, under certain circumstances, to restrict the processing of your information, in which case, we will not process your information for any purpose other than storing it; <br><br>(vi) you have the right, under certain circumstances, to obtain the erasure of your Personal Information from us; <br><br>(vii) you have the right to receive your information in a structured, commonly used and machine readable format and, if technically feasible, to have it transmitted to another controller without any hindrance.

<h3>Do Not Track signals</h3>
Some browsers incorporate a Do Not Track feature that signals to websites you visit that you do not want to have your online activity tracked. Tracking is not the same as using or collecting information in connection with a website. For these purposes, tracking refers to collecting personally identifiable information from consumers who use or visit a website or online service as they move across different websites over time. How browsers communicate the Do Not Track signal is not yet uniform. As a result, this Website is not yet set up to interpret or respond to Do Not Track signals communicated by your browser. Even so, as described in more detail throughout this Policy, we limit our use and collection of your personal information.
<br><br>

<br><br>

When we do, we will send you an email.
